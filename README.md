===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

##How to run the game locally
You download all the files for the game 
You open index.html in a browser

## How to play the game
The game starts with a player and some enemy bugs going across the screen.
The aim is to get the player to the water without colliding with any of the bugs.
If the player collides with the bug, the player goes to the beginning of the game
If the player crosses to the water and win, the game resets

The arrow keys are used for moving the player around
You use the up, down, left and right key to move up, down, left, right respectively

##Prequisites
This is a very simple project. All you need is a code editor and a browser.

## Contributing
